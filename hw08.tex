First thing I did was added the check \verb|if(threadIdx.x < fold)| to check that only 
threads in the first half of each fold is aggregating values from the second half. 

Next bug: in the check statement for odd sized folds, I changed it so that 
\verb|id + (fold - 1) < n| since we are in c-indexing (starting at 0 rather than 1)

After printing out each of the \verb|blockDim.x| entries of the \verb|C_CPU| vector, 
I discovered that the algorithm did compute the dot product correctly and also folded correctly. 
But somehow when adding up correct values, the end result was off by one. This is because 
the values were stored as floats, where the precision does not allow for certain numbers to 
be represented (in particular, values around 55,555,555-55,555,560) using the 
restricted mantissa of a float. 
So although those vectors were accurately multiplied and condensed into the first 
index on each block, the 
summing up was not accurately recording the output until the results were stored in a 
\verb|double| rather than a \verb|float|.
